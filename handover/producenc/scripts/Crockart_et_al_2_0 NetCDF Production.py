And an updated Law Dome (LD, Dome Summit South site) ice core record collected in 2016/2017 (extends the record presented in Vance et al. 2013). Log means log-transformed. Na means sodium, and Cl means chloride (originally both in Î¼Eq l-1, although the log-transformed values are presented here). Accum means snowfall accumulation measured in m yr-1 IE (IE stands for ice equivalent). MBS Charlie chloride and soidum values are excluded in the year 1987 as this was an outlier. These are not detrended values."
